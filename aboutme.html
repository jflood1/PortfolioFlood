        <p>Hello, Bernie here, a Graphic Design graduate from <span class="bold-text">California State University Dominguez Hills (CSUDH).</span> Prior to CSUDH, I earned my certificate from <span class="bold-text">Orange Coast College,</span>  completing my <span class="bold-text"></span>
             This program introduced me to <span class="bold-text">Digital Arts Design and Concept, </span> along with <span class="bold-text">Painting, Art History, and Basic Drawing.</span> During my time at OCC, I received training in design principles and composition aesthetics, preparing me for higher education at the university level. </p>
             <p>Currently residing in Medford, Oregon, I spent 3 years in Orange County and a decade in the Bay Area. Graphic Imaging has fascinated me since my youth, and although pursued later in my career, I continue to discover its immense potential.
                With a strong foundation in visual and art direction, I am proficient in <span class="bold-text">Adobe Creative Cloud </span> and have recently acquired skills in  <span class="bold-text">web development using Visual Studio Code,</span> enhancing my abilities in <span class="bold-text">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</span>  
              I draw inspiration from influential Graphic Designers of our time such as Fabien Baron, Bea Feistler, and Ruth Ansel, who fuel my creative passion.  </p>
